Hi! I'm Jimmy, a third-year computer science at the University of Southern California. Since taking my first introduction to programming course in college, I have been infatuated by the artistry and problem-solving necessary for full-stack web development. Through personal and academic projects, I have had the opportunity to apply my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, including JavaScript, React, React Native, SQL, and Node.js. Beyond programming, I'm also passionate about tennis, cooking Korean cuisine, and oil painting. 

Feel free to contact me or just look around!
